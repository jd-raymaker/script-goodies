# Start-Cleanup
This tool cleans up your folder and moves every file in it to a pre-defined folder structure.

Perfect to use on your Downloads folder where files gets cluttered up quickly :)

## Example
```powershell
.\Start-Cleanup.ps1 -path C:\temp
```

## OSX or Linux?
This was coded with Powershell Core in mind. So it should work cross platform (not tested yet)

## Why?
I'm lazy..  that's why :)
